1. ABOUT STORM SQUIRREL
=======================

Thanks for trying Strom Squirrel.

Our intention is to make it a lightweight and easy to use mail client with some nice
features (like synchronization between hosts in your local network).

Please remember that it is still in pre-Alpha software. So just be carefull :-)

We hope you will like it.

Sun's Java JRE 1.5.0 also known as 5.0;
System $HOME variable set to your home directory;

===============
3. INSTALLATION
===============

TO INSTALL FROM SNAPSHOT - just run Install.sh script and it will do the rest :-)

TO COMPILE FROM SOURCES- if you have apache-ant and jikes compiler installed
just run ant or use run script. If not, you have to compile every file separatly
(but Ant can realy make it a lot easier).

If you want to use another compiler (for example Sun's javac), you have to remove
compiler="jikes" in
<javac compiler="jikes" srcdir="${src}" destdir="${build}"/>
For other compilers please read Ant's documentation.

TO COMPILE FROM SOURCES AND INSTALL - run install.sh from main sources dir
and it will do the rest :-) (You have to be root to do it).
