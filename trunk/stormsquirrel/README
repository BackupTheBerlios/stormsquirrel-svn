Thanks for reading this file.

What you need to test Storm Squirrel pre-Alpha version:

Sun's Java JRE 1.5.0 also known as 5.0;
A config file  config.conf(like the example) in your home directory in .StormSquirrel subdirectory;
System $HOME variable set to your home directory;
An mbox file with mails :-);

Please USE A COPY OF YOUR MBOX FILE! Storm Squirrel is a beggining project
and it can destroy your mail! (but for now it's quite safe. It only reads. Writing
is not yet supported :-)

And... those buttons on the top... they don't work yet.

TO COMPILE - if you have apache-ant installed just run ant or use run script. If not
you have to compile every file separatly: javac gui.java ...

TO COMPILE AND INSTALL - run install.sh and it will do the rest :-)
